The original comment is as follows:
----
Glyphs are imported from the Baekmuk font and heavily modified
  to make a new font named as a johab font.
Hangul fonts are automatically generated from this johab(32x15x11) font.
Symbol glyphs are made by Woo-Hyun Jang <louis@mail.mizi.com>
  and retouched by Won-kyu Park <wkpark@kldp.org>
Hanja glyphs are imported from K12.bdf(a japaness public domain font)
  and missing glyphs are made by wkpark@kldp.org
